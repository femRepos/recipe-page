## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learnt how to use the root selector and css variables.

```css
:root {
  font-size: 16px;
  /* Colors */

  /* Primary */
  --nutmeg: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  --dark-raspberry: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);

  /* Neutral */
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --rose-white: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
  --eggshell: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
  --light-grey: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
  --wenge-brown: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
  --dark-charcoal: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
}
```
